Heroes of Pymoli Analysis
•	Gender Behavior: Overall Heroes of Pymoli has a player base that is primarily male. While the majority of sales and users are Male, Females and Other/Non-Disclose users have higher average price and average purchase value per person. The data for Other is limited, but Female purchase behavior has enough data behind it to suggest trying to acquire more female users would be the ideal strategy moving forward.
•	Age Behavior: The top three age brackets of users are 20-24, 15-19 and 25-29 based on population. 20-24, 30-34, and 35-39 are the age budgets with the highest average total purchase price per person. The under 10 age range bucket also has a high purchase per person amount, but should not be targeted due to legality of targeting minors. 
•	Top Items: Final Critic and Oathbreaker are both the top most profitable and top most popular items in the game. The items in the 3-5 spot change based on purchase count, however all are around 8-9 purchases so the different as far as popularity goes is negligible. The recommendation is to focus on creating more product similar in design to the top 5 most profitable items.
•	Summary: The strategy for the game going forward should be to focus on acquiring female players ages 20-24, 30-34, and 35-39. This would lead to increase the most profitable user segments and leading to the greatest growth for the game. We should also focus on developing new items similar to the most profitable items in order to design products that appeal to that demographic the most, although we may want more granular analysis on how those specific segments purchase.
